Red Bread Crossover Mod is a Red Dead-themed crossover mod for Cookie Clicker.

RBCM is currently only available in English, and may conflict with other mods that modify the news ticker or texture replacement functionality. If you have another mod that replaces any building sprites or the icons.png file, you may experience some inconsistencies or undesired graphical behaviour. Depending on the conflict, these issues might be fixable by adjusting the loading order of mods in the game's settings.

You install the [Red Bread Crossover Userscript](https://voltacceptyt.github.io/redbreadcrossover/RBCM.user.js) to use the mod!

- Toggle Buttons
  - Used to Toggle Active Mod Elements
- Custom Achievements
  - Adds 4 Custom Achievements to The Game
- Modified Buildings
  - Modifies the **Fractal Engine** and Turns it into The Wild West

Eventually, I'd like to add even more custom Read Dead-themed content to Red Bread Crossover, including reskins for building minigames and custom flavoured cookie upgrades. Until then, happy baking!
